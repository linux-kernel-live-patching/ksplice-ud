Udis86 Disassembler for x86 and x86-64 (AMD64)
==============================================
(http://udis86.sourceforge.net/)

Udis86 is an easy-to-use minimalistic disassembler library (libudis86) for the
x86 and x86-64 (AMD64) range of instruction set architectures. The primary 
intent of the design and development of udis86 is to aid software development 
projects that entail binary code analysis.

Salient features of libudis86:

    * Full support for the x86 and x86-64 (AMD64) ISAs.
    * Includes support for all MMX, SSE, FPU(x87), and AMD 3Dnow! Instructions
    * Supports 16/32/64 Bits disassembly modes.
    * Capable of generating output in AT&T or INTEL assembly language syntax.
    * Plugin-in based model for customizing ouput syntax.
    * Supports different types of inputs - File, Buffered, and Hooks.
    * Thread-safe and Reentrant.
    * API consists of multi-level wrappers for fine-grained control over the 
      decoder.

Building Udis86
===============

On Unix(-like) Systems:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

This will build the library as well as a simple command line front end.

Using libudis86
===============

See docs/API.txt

Using udcli
===========

For disassembling a 32 bit binary file foobar.bin, to intel (nasm-like) syntax:

	$ udcli -32 -intel < foobar.bin

For more help:

	$ udcli -h
